- looked at yahoo tech talks
- spoke with jignesh and went over the script he runs in a cron job
- look up how to send email from unix
	mail -s "subject" recipient@yahoo.com
	cat file/containing/message | mail -s "subject" recipient@yahoo.com
	uuencode file.jpeg file.jpeg | mail recipient@yahoo.com

    team of people reviews the creatives in the queues

    move the repot from emails to an on demand web ui 

    look at the structure of the tables and understand the structure of the querieis
    learn how to do what jignesh does manually
    figure out a way to atuoamte from there
    emberjs, appkit
