- take two strings as input
- create tokenizer
    - fill out tokenizer struct
    - fill out tokenizer creation function
    - fill out tokenizer destruction function
- iterate over first string of separator characters and create a bit vector representing the existence of a character as a separator
    - iterate over string
    - grab non-escaped characters
    - grab escape characters
    - create bit vector
    - add to bit vector
- iterate over tokens string and use created bit vector to check for delims
    - if delim match print out current char string accumulated
    - print out new line
    - reset char accumulation and continue until '\0' detected
    - convert any escape characters to their hex values
- organize everything as a struct
