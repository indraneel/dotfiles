There shouldn't be any bugs, hopefully.  I should explain why this is late, though.  When I first submitted, I didn't realize that my optimizer didn't handle multiple optimizations in the same output file.  I fixed it, wrapping my optimization loop in another loop that ran everytime an optimization occurred.
