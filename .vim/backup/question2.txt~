Indraneel Purohit
I am not just a startup enthusiast, CS student and budding developer!  I spent two years of high school working as a freelance blogger for Gadgetell.com and Appletell.com, writing for an audience of 200,000 unique users per month.  I am also a huge history buff and a member of Rutgers' Model United Nations and Model Congress organizations.  I help put on a conference for high school students to actively learn about public policy, current events, public speaking and citizenship.  I'm also something of a music producer; I primarily love and make hip hop, a genre that I can talk about for days on end.

You can find me spending long hours in front of Logic Pro figuring out chord progressions and cursing myself for quitting piano lessons.
