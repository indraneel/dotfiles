3/26/13 - Tuesday 2pm-5pm
	Others here: Josh, Katie, Harry
	First day! 
	Set up work environment.	
	Set up on Solaris.
	Built and deployed nano 2.3.2 (testing) to Solaris9.
	Set up on CentOS/opus5/Koji
4/1/13 - Monday 2pm-5pm
	Others here: Josh, Katie, Harry, Jarek, Matthew (also new)
	attempting to build nano on CentOS
	there's no nano package on CentOS, need to add
	there's no nano specfile for CentOS, need to make or find	
	quick detour to read about Fedora, CentOS, yum, upstream, etc. (i.e., all
	the terms that are thrown around that I only understand in context) =>
	put these things in help.txt
4/2/13 - Tuesday 2pm-
	Others here: Josh and Katie until 3 (didn't start doing anything until
	they left)
	didn't send srpm for nano 2.2.6-1 to koji yesterday; doing that now.
	built to staging successfully!
		build DID NOT work when i tried to pushpackage to rutgers-testing.
		even though I built the build for centos6 (.ru6), it is failing on centos5. so
		pushpackage or rutgers-testing must test against centos5 (and 6?) and won't
		work if the rpm doesn't support centos5. this is a problem i do not know the
		immediate solution to.	

		ssh'd into centos5-64-build, but i can't run rpm -i on here. i
		think i might have a permissions problem that I don't know about.
4/8/13 - Monday 2pm - 	
	Others here: matt, josh, katie, harry, jarek
	pushed nano to centos6
	rebuilt webtools for centos6 and pushed
	--
	now i'm doing things
	that jarek wants me to do:
		editing a package to include some cron scripts
		building cron scripts into a package	

4/9/13 - Tuesday 2pm -
	still fixing rutgers-repotools to include kojibackup.sh and
automagiccheck.py inside of the cron.daily 
	confused as to how i can update rutgers-repotools from opus5 if it
only exists on omachi...
	GOT IT THANK YOU HARRY! I HAVE TO UNTAR AND GO INSIDE THE UNTARRED
DIR AND ADD THE FILES THAT WAY ON OPUS. then i can move automagiccheck and kojibackup
into rutgers-repo[untarred] and then add the shell scripts that i have to
write that call the aforementioned scripts the way they are called in
/etc/crontab/.  make sure I bump the minor version number (_._.X) in the
tarball name, specfile, and all internal references to it (like setup.py)
	i have more questions though:
		what does %{config} do in the specfile?
		how do i add references to new files? probably just going to
copy how they're done for depcheck

4/16/13 - Tuesday 2pm-5pm
	[no entry: why?]
		

4/22/13 - Monday 2pm-5pm
	handed in mine and matt's vouchers
	still working on rutgers-repotools	
	pulled from github
	added .py and .sh scripts to cron.daily
	wrote shell script that runs both as specified currently in crontab
	don't know how to check if this actually works

4/23/13 - Tuesday 2pm-5pm
	got package to build correctly! new script and all. 
	have to figure out how to test it
4/29/13 - Monday 2pm-5pm
	installing on omachi-new
	installed on omachi-new successfully
	now to build python-createrepo (rutgers-repotools dependency) for centos6
	then to throw everything back into the original git repo issue a pull request?
